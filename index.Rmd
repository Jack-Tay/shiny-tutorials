title: 'Shiny Tutorials'
---

I'm going to create a series of tutorials for creating shiny apps for psychology research and teaching.

### Tutorials 

* [Creating your first app](01-first-app.html)
* [Data collection](https://gupsych.github.io/tquant/data-input.html)

### Resources

* [Definitions](defs.html) - I'm tryng to define common terms as I write these tutorials
* [RStudio Shiny Tutorials](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) - These are way better than my tutorials
* [Shiny Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#shiny) - Everyone needs a wall covered in cheat sheets next to their computer
